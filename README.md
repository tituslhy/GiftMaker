So have I! 

### This tool comprises: <br>
1. **Video stitcher**: Stitches all recorded videos into a single video. This can be used for data pre-processing or used to stitch a compilation as a gift.
2. **Automatic speech recognition**: Using OpenAI's whisper model, we transcribe the meaningful messages into text for the LLM to do its work.
3. **Generative AI**: Using langchain, we call the LLM (ChatGPT/HuggingFace models/other langchain supported LLMs) to do something funny - like write out an entire dating profile of your friend in html using the video transcript from Whisper. This can then be given as a gift to your friend as well

This tool was tested using my personal repository of video montages from friends appreciating other friends.
